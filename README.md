# Personal Portfolio Website
This website was developed as part of Assignment 02 to demonstrate foundational web development skills using HTML and CSS. The project focuses on creating a well-structured webpage with organized content, consistent styling, and improved visual presentation through the use of an external stylesheet. Throughout this assignment, I applied principles of semantic HTML, layout design, and readability to produce a functional and user-friendly webpage. This project represents my continued growth in understanding core web design concepts and building professional-quality digital content.
